## Markdown
Based heavily on ```marked's``` Regex (just the regex, the code is purely written custom and uses nothing else beside ```marked's``` regex expression (thanks)

## Current Status
Markdown support is not complete, most Block code is complete besides lists and tables. There is very little inline parsing done yet, and links are not implemented yet. These will come in time.

### Github style markdown
Is not going to be included directly within the Markdown mode, it will be included in a seperate mode that can be added to the list of modes at runtime, effectively giving you github style and basic markdown options.
